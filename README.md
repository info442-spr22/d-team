## Mission Statement:
>To inform the public about sustainable electronic usage and e-waste recycling practices.
 
## Problem Statement:
Electronic waste continues to proliferate and is not being disposed of in a responsible way due to lack of knowledge and accessible e-waste recycling resources, posing significant health risks to children in third world countries.

Irresponsible disposal of electronic waste is a problem that may not be presently visible; however, it poses massive concerns for the health of future generations. Improper disposal of e-waste results in poisonous chemicals residing in soil and water, as well as losing out on scarce and valuable resources that are used in producing electronics (https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2021/goal-12/). Barring its economic impact, this problem isnâ€™t directly relevant to current quality of life, yet there has been a defined relationship between e-waste and child health. Changes in lung function, respiratory and respiratory effects, DNA damage, impaired thyroid function and increased risk of some chronic diseases have all been linked to e-waste (https://www.who.int/news/item/15-06-2021-soaring-e-waste-affects-the-health-of-millions-of-children-who-warns).

Long-lasting health impacts pose a significant problem and e-waste is a particularly severe issue in developing countries. Currently, there are many options to recycle devices that export these devices to developing countries where workers use recycling techniques, such as acid leaching and cable burning, to recover gold, silver, copper, and other valuable metals (https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/programs/geh/geh_newsletter/2014/2/spotlight/ewaste_an_emerging_health_risk_.cfm). This causes workers to be directly exposed to toxic chemicals and substances which can harshly impact their health.

E-waste is growing to be a much more significant issue due to an increase in supply and demand for devices. This is in part due to electronic devices becoming cheaper, as well as device lifespans becoming shorter (https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2018/08/27/growing-e-waste-problem/). These factors lead to much higher levels of e-waste simply because more electronic devices are being purchased, used, and disposed of.

There are currently solutions to the increasing rates of irresponsible e-waste, such as fighting for the right-to-repair or providing opportunities for safe electronic device recycling (https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2018/08/27/growing-e-waste-problem/). However, many of these solutions are not accessible to all users, such as users who may not know that they can even repair their devices. There are also many different opportunities to recycle electronics, but it's hard to find out whether these options recycle responsibly.
